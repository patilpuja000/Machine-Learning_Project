About Dataset
Context:
This synthetic healthcare dataset has been created to serve as a valuable resource for data science, machine learning, and data analysis enthusiasts. It is designed to mimic 
real-world healthcare data, enabling users to practice, develop, and showcase their data manipulation and analysis skills in the context of the healthcare industry.

Inspiration:
The inspiration behind this dataset is rooted in the need for practical and diverse healthcare data for educational and research purposes. Healthcare data is often sensitive and 
subject to privacy regulations, making it challenging to access for learning and experimentation. To address this gap, I have leveraged Python's Faker library to generate a dataset 
that mirrors the structure and attributes commonly found in healthcare records. By providing this synthetic data, I hope to foster innovation, learning, and knowledge sharing in the 
healthcare analytics domain.

Dataset Information:
Each column provides specific information about the patient, their admission, and the healthcare services provided, making this dataset suitable for various data analysis and 
modeling tasks in the healthcare domain. Here's a brief explanation of each column in the dataset -

Name: This column represents the name of the patient associated with the healthcare record.
Age: The age of the patient at the time of admission, expressed in years.
Gender: Indicates the gender of the patient, either "Male" or "Female."
Blood Type: The patient's blood type, which can be one of the common blood types (e.g., "A+", "O-", etc.).
Medical Condition: This column specifies the primary medical condition or diagnosis associated with the patient, such as "Diabetes," "Hypertension," "Asthma," and more.
Date of Admission: The date on which the patient was admitted to the healthcare facility.
Doctor: The name of the doctor responsible for the patient's care during their admission.
Hospital: Identifies the healthcare facility or hospital where the patient was admitted.
Insurance Provider: This column indicates the patient's insurance provider, which can be one of several options, including "Aetna," "Blue Cross," "Cigna," "UnitedHealthcare," and 
"Medicare."
Billing Amount: The amount of money billed for the patient's healthcare services during their admission. This is expressed as a floating-point number.
Room Number: The room number where the patient was accommodated during their admission.
Admission Type: Specifies the type of admission, which can be "Emergency," "Elective," or "Urgent," reflecting the circumstances of the admission.
Discharge Date: The date on which the patient was discharged from the healthcare facility, based on the admission date and a random number of days within a realistic range.
Medication: Identifies a medication prescribed or administered to the patient during their admission. Examples include "Aspirin," "Ibuprofen," "Penicillin," "Paracetamol," and 
"Lipitor."
Test Results: Describes the results of a medical test conducted during the patient's admission. Possible values include "Normal," "Abnormal," or "Inconclusive," indicating the 
outcome of the test.
Usage Scenarios:
This dataset can be utilized for a wide range of purposes, including:

Developing and testing healthcare predictive models.
Practicing data cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques.
Creating data visualizations to gain insights into healthcare trends.
Learning and teaching data science and machine learning concepts in a healthcare context.
You can treat it as a Multi-Class Classification Problem and solve it for Test Results which contains 3 categories(Normal, Abnormal, and Inconclusive).


Natural Language Processing

This dataset contains a collection of tweets with the hashtag #chatgpt. The tweets were scraped from Twitter and cover a range of topics related to the ChatGPT language model. 
The dataset includes the following information for each tweet:

Tweet text
User information (username, user ID, location, etc.)
Tweet timestamp
Retweet and favorite count
Hashtags used in the tweet
URLs
The dataset provides a glimpse into the online conversation surrounding the ChatGPT language model and can be used for various natural language processing and machine learning 
tasks, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and more. It allows understanding the community, the level of interest, and the use of chatGPT.



Recommendations Systems 

The dataset contains over 41 million cleaned and preprocessed user recommendations (reviews) from a Steam Store - a leading online platform for purchasing and downloading video 
games, DLC, and other gaming-related content. Additionally, it contains detailed information about games and add-ons.

Content
The dataset consists of three main entities:

games.csv - a table of games (or add-ons) information on ratings, pricing in US dollars $, release date, etc. A piece of extra non-tabular details on games, such as descriptions 
and tags, is in a metadata file;
users.csv - a table of user profiles' public information: the number of purchased products and reviews published;
recommendations.csv - a table of user reviews: whether the user recommends a product. The table represents a many-many relation between a game entity and a user entity.
The dataset does not contain any personal information about users on a Steam Platform. A preprocessing pipeline anonymized all user IDs. All collected data is accessible to a 
member of the general public.
